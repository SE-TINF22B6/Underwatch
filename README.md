## Introduction

Underwatch is a game which was created as a student project at DHBW. 
We created a 2D-Pixelart-Hack'n'Slash-Shooting game which hopefully suits your tastes.
Currently the game is in a very bare bone but still playable state.

If you are looking for the documentation which was created during that course head over to the [📖 Wiki](https://github.com/SE-TINF22B6/Underwatch/wiki/System-Architecture-Documentation).
