## Software Architecture Documentation
> This template is a simplified version based on the documentation templates from IBM Rational Unified Process (RUP) and arc42.org (https://docs.arc42.org/home/)
> If necessary, you can add more topics related to the architecture design of your application.

### 1. Introduction
#### 1.1 Overview
The following patterns are selling points of our architecture, covering the game, the website and our backend
1. *Model-View-Controller (MVC):*
   - `Game`: Separates game logic (Model), rendering (View), and user input (Controller), enhancing modularity and maintainability.
   - `Website`: Uses MVC to segregate data handling, UI, and control flow, making it easier to manage and extend.

2. *Client-Server Architecture:*
   - `Backend Integration`: Game acts as the client requesting high scores from the server, ensuring a clear division between frontend gameplay and backend data processing.
   - `Scalability`: Enables the backend to scale independently, handling more players and higher loads without modifying the game client.

3. *Layered Architecture:*
   - `Application Layer`: Manages game logic and user input processing.
   - `Data Layer`: Interfaces with backend services and databases for persistent storage and retrieval of high scores.

4. *RESTful Architecture:*
   - `API Design`: Backend provides RESTful APIs for high score data exchange, following standard HTTP methods and stateless operations for simplicity and interoperability.

5. *Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA):*
   - `High Scores Service`: A dedicated service for managing high score data, allowing for independent scaling and updating without impacting other backend components.

6. *Event-Driven Architecture:*
   - `Game Events`: Utilizes event-driven mechanisms for gameplay actions (e.g., scoring points, game over), ensuring responsive and decoupled game logic.

7. *Repository Pattern:*
   - `Data Access`: Encapsulates data access logic within repositories, providing a clean separation of data retrieval and manipulation from business logic.

8. *Singleton Pattern:*
   - `Game Manager`: Ensures a single instance of core game management classes, controlling the gameâ€™s state and lifecycle uniformly.

By incorporating these architectural patterns, our design ensures robust, scalable, and maintainable software that can efficiently support the features and future growth of the project.

#### 1.2 Constraints
> Any technical or organizational constraints, conventions (Tips: https://docs.arc42.org/section-2/)
#### 1.2.1 Technical Constraints
| Constraint | Background and /or motivation|
|-|-|
|Operating on Linux, Mac, and Windows | We want the largest possible user-base. |
|Implementation in Java and React| We use Java 21 for the game and the backend. Our website is written with React |

#### 1.2.2 Organizational Constraints
| Constraint | Background and /or motivation|
|-|-|
|Team|Martin, Benjamin, Jeremias and Jakob in the current course Tinf22B6|
|Schedule| Start of work with beginning of the third semester. First presentable version at the end of the third semester. Advanced final version at the end of the fourth semester.|
|Development Tools| IDE: bring your own. Diagramms: DrawIO or PlantUML. Versioning: Git. Host: Github|
|Release as Open Source| The code is made available as open source|
#### 1.2.3 Conventions
| Convention | Background and /or motivation|
|-|-|
|Architecture Documentation| We will use the structure according to the lecture Software-Engineering and use the provided templates (sad.md, srs.md, and emmm.org)|
