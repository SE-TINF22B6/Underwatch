# Project Name
## Software Architecture Documentation
> This template is a simplified version based on the documentation templates from IBM Rational Unified Process (RUP) and arc42.org (https://docs.arc42.org/home/)
> If necessary, you can add more topics related to the architecture design of your application.

### 1. Introduction
#### 1.1 Overview
> What are the selling points of your architecture design?
#### 1.2 Constraints
> Any technical or organizational constraints, conventions (Tips: https://docs.arc42.org/section-2/)
#### 1.2.1 Technical Constraints
| Constraint | Background and /or motivation|
|-|-|
|Operating on Linux, Mac, and Windows | We want the largest possible user-base. |
|Implementation in Java and React| We use Java 21 for the game and the backend. Our website is written with React |

#### 1.2.2 Organizational Constraints
| Constraint | Background and /or motivation|
|-|-|
|Team|Martin, Benjamin, Jeremias and Jakob in the current course Tinf22B6|
|Schedule| Start of work with beginning of the third semester. First presentable version at the end of the third semester. Advanced final version at the end of the fourth semester.|
|Development Tools| IDE: bring your own. Diagramms: DrawIO or PlantUML. Versioning: Git. Host: Github|
|Release as Open Source| The code is made available as open source|
#### 1.2.3 Conventions
| Convention | Background and /or motivation|
|-|-|
|Architecture Documentation| We will use the structure according to the lecture Software-Engineering and use the provided templates (sad.md, srs.md, and emmm.org)|
#### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms and Abbreviations
> Definitions of all terms, acronyms, and abbreviations required to properly interpret this document.
#### 1.4 References
> A complete list of all documents referenced -- hyperlinks to those documents.

### 2. Architecture tactics
> Reference your architecturally significant requirements from Semester 3.
> Revise your architecture tactics from Semester 3.

### 3. Architecture design
> This section specifies the architecture design in various views.
> Minimum requirement:
> - sequence diagram on a component level and necessary description
> - component diagrams and/or package diagrams, and necessary description
